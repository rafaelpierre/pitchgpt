       "['For a band whose touchstone would soon become obdurate slowness, Acetone certainly began on the record industry’s fast track. In the early ’90s, when music executives were quick with cash, the unproven trio of California students inked a deal with a nascent Virgin imprint on a demo alone. On the prowl for the next alt-rock crossover phenomenon, Vernon Yard—named for the English enclave where Virgin began two decades earlier—offered Acetone $400,000 (nearly a million today), making them the inaugural act on a roster that would soon include the Verve, Low, and David Gray.\\nThere were promotional budgets, tours with Oasis and Garbage, and the growing realization that their pained, gorgeous, and patient records could never actually recoup those kinds of post-Nirvana costs. This was not music for MTV but instead for a meditative and melancholy cloister, folks with the time and temperament to sit still with these graceful testaments to existential ache. After Vernon Yard dropped Acetone into a legacy of penury, they made two of indie rock’s most exquisite albums for Neil Young’s new Vapor label. Still, those didn’t take. And in 2001, at 34, bassist Richie Lee—whose twilit voice and heroin woes had been Acetone’s angel and devil—died by suicide. Ever since, Acetone have continued their descent into cultish obscurity, their records long out of print and mostly not streaming, a band on the fast track to the record industry’s wasteland.\\nAt last, I’m still waiting. puts Acetone on their proper pedestal as one of their generation’s most hypnotic acts. They are like Bedhead without the morning-time stiffness or Mojave 3 with more earworm ease, a band wrongly forgotten among contemporaries they often bested. A titanic 11xLP box set that collects almost all of Acetone’s recorded work, I’m still waiting. doubles as a love letter for three kids—Lee, drummer Steve Hadley, and guitarist Mark Lightcap—who were lured inside a vicious system that did not know what to do with their muted wonder except write it off as a loss. For the first time ever, their four LPs will be available at once (as a set and as standalone records) and eventually on streaming, having outlived both Vernon Yard and Vapor in aptly tragic fashion. Three decades after Acetone accepted that $400,000 check, their music still radiates a hangdog sort of hope, holding on even as the idea of letting go beckons.\\nAmid the big-game hunt for the next Nirvana, Acetone looked and sort of sounded the part—Lee’s dirty grunge curls, the beautiful Hadley’s thousand-yard stare, Lightcap’s steely glower. Their Acetone EP, released in 1993, is a fiery baptism of distortion and dynamics, the first three songs grinding through Big Muff riffs and splenetic solos but pausing for uncanny spans of pillowed harmony. “D.F.B.,” a four-minute excoriation of a dead asshole, called “next” during a Stone Temple Pilots/White Zombie Rock Block. But then there’s closer “Cindy,” an imaginative and enigmatic eight-minute devotional about virginity or black-widow-like sacrifice or narcotized oblivion. The song is a seesaw, rising into heavy outbursts before falling repeatedly into quiet passages so vulnerable and delicate that they suggest rehearsal tapes, at least until you notice how intentional the playing is. No faint note is out of place, no twinge of dissonance accidental.\\nAcetone’s next eight years—that is, nearly their entire oeuvre—unspool from that locus, on four albums that descend toward low-volume silence before rising again for one last outburst. In fact, “Cindy” became such a touchstone that they named their 1993 full-length debut for it without including the track itself. Blistering bits of rock speckled Cindy’s 55 minutes, like the tube-screaming “Pinch” or the space-rock ascendance of “Endless Summer.” But they are mere blisters, aberrations on a surface so wide and smooth it’s easy to get lost there. A plea to a lover set on leaving, “Louise,” moves with doo-wop grace, subdued until it twinkles as faintly as a distant star. Low would not release I Could Live in Hope for another year, so “No Need Swim” gets to their paradigm—gentle but insistent harmonies that dovetail so well they sound like one voice and its shadow, over a rhythm that hides inside that heat—first. “I’m a molecule of water, flying over Niagara Falls,” they sing, masterfully framing existence as a free fall into someone else’s inescapable reality.\\nIndeed, they did soon descend into the merciless pit of the music industry and its endless grind for commercial attention. Hadley and Lee surrendered to heroin, perhaps informing the astral gaze and icy pace of what was becoming their best work but not necessarily helpful for writing more of it. Decamping to a modest Nashville studio for an extended stay, they managed only to make parts of two records. The results were, artistically, worth the expense: I Guess I Would, a brilliant country covers EP, relaxes into the work of George Jones and John Prine like a featherbed, indulging in these little tragedies. A setting of William Blake’s “How Sweet I Roam’d from Field to Field,” earlier attempted by the Fugs, is so hazy it feels like ascending heavenward through clouds, life itself just a memory.\\nThey revel in that languid state for 1995’s If You Only Knew, having finally accepted how they wanted to sound. The distortion and vim of just two years earlier appears here only as aberrations, little ripples on a seemingly placid pool where the real drama lurks beneath the veneer. A song so still its melodic motion barely registers, “Esque” is pure heartbreak, a confession from an addict who can’t quite register some bad thing that might have happened yesterday. “When You’re Gone” is another transmission from the edge of confusion, now turned toward a future Lee isn’t sure he has. Guitar and bass lock into a slow-motion death waltz. This is Acetone at the lip of an abyss, where the view is grand but the stakes are grander still.\\nTurmoil soon ensued between Acetone and Vernon Yard, then entangled in a lawsuit from Verve Records about the use of the name the Verve, just as that band became Vernon Yard’s star. Lee accused the label of not working hard enough to promote the band’s record, not pushing it into enough stores. On the other hand, what was Vernon Yard to do with a big investment who had gone so quiet they’d barely be audible through a car’s FM receiver? Lee rightly rejected grunge as Acetone’s scene and got flustered when folks called him the next Gram Parsons or suggested Acetone were “the new kings of the No Depression movement,” a coronation that vastly overestimated the stylistic boundaries of that scene. What were Acetone trying to be, anyway? Vernon Yard didn’t stick around to find out, cutting them loose after If You Only Knew spiraled toward the cutout bin.\\nAnd so, as though in retribution, they made their masterpiece for Neil Young. The 12-track Acetone is focused and intentional in a way the band had never been, sorting through the suffering of survival with tenderness and intensity. “All You Know” is a warped country nightmare, slide guitar and smeared notes underscoring lines about going onward even as everything goes badly. Vaguely threatening and entirely enchanting, “Might as Well” deploys the notion that no one really cares about anyone else as a strange romantic lure. It’s an invitation to disappear completely into being unknown.\\nAll of the record goes on in this way: a quiet quest for the silver linings that come with continuing, in spite of the struggles. This is the last record Acetone would self-produce, and the lessons of their Vernon Yard tenure serve them well. Everything is mic’d so closely that it often feels as if you’re resting your head on Hadley’s snare or Lightcap’s amplifier, that they’re whispering to you as Lee sorts through notebooks of soft blue feelings. Acetone chafed at subgenres, “slowcore” in particular. But Acetone is both apogee and access point for the form, its effortless sense of melody turning its shuffles and sways into vortices.\\nIt is tempting to reduce Acetone’s end and even existence to Lee’s suicide—“to [overwrite] creative and contingent decisions with a fatal trajectory that seems both inescapable and unverifiable,” Drew Daniel of Matmos writes in this set’s empathetic and incisive liner notes. But Acetone’s final album, 2000’s ***York Blvd.***, suggests that they had already reached their cruising altitude, that they were now gilding a wonderfully gray lily. (Prime Cuts, a newly compiled potpourri of demos, lost tracks, and live recordings, confirms that sense.) Vapor enlisted Eric Sarafin, who had previously mixed several Ben Harper records, to helm the sessions, while Acetone brought in Jason Yates to add subtle organ lines. Lightcap even plays trumpet. Much of that old crunch returns alongside a dash of outright soul, both marketing hooks in waiting. But the best songs, like “Stray” or “One Drop,” are archetypal Acetone: methodical drifts toward a future that may not even exist.\\nYork Blvd. begins with “Things Are Gonna Be Alright,” a sunnily titled song for a country still lingering in the afterglow of “You Get What You Give.” But it was a feint for a tune that, like Acetone’s music at large, soon went quiet and dark. “You may try and try again/Not to be unsatisfied, just squeezing by one more time,” they sing as the riff ricochets repeatedly, vaguely peppy despite what’s coming. “But how long do you go on/Believing things are gonna be alright?”\\nAs with most things Acetone ever made, it is simultaneously disarming and unsettling, a balm for the ears that also registers as a lump in the throat. Hearing Lightcap and Lee sing those lines now, it’s hard not to grieve the way it all went down for Acetone, their striking music lost to the shuffle of major labels and ephemeral trends. At least you can hear it now, in this box of absolute treasure salvaged from the collective cultural jetsam of the ’90s.',\n",
       " \"As an artist in a genre where emerging stars are rarely old enough to drive, let alone drink, Danny Brown has always seemed self-conscious about his age. His breakout mixtape, XXX, was titled in part to reference his age at the time. His next album title was even less subtle. Quaranta—“40” in Italian but also, a near-homonym for “quarantine”—arrives as Brown enters his fourth decade, and he’s called it a “spiritual sequel to XXX.” That’s a bit misleading though, because Quaranta is a very different record. Across a number of solemn, lyric-heavy tracks, Brown catalogs his regrets and owns up to his personal failings. If XXX felt like a never-ending carousel of sex and drugs, Quaranta feels more like sitting in a therapist's office processing the fallout from a decade of rockstar living.\\nThe last few years have given Brown a lot to unpack. A lifelong Detroiter, he relocated to Austin, Texas following a divorce; earlier this year he got sober after a stint in rehab. He wrote Quaranta during the initial wave of COVID lockdown and it sounds like it. Brown’s stance is isolated and reflective; he raps deliberately over sparse beats, his delivery more confessional than flamboyant. Where his previous albums approached similar topics (Old, in particular, attempted to reconcile Brown’s hedonistic lifestyle and traumatic childhood), the music and rapping were far more dynamic. On Quaranta, Brown’s acrobatic flows, ear for oddball beats, and dark sense of humor are in short supply.\\nBrown has always been equal parts traditionalist and insurgent. While he led a wave of internet-fluent rappers who crossed over into indie and EDM, his mastery of storytelling and technique betrayed his love of ’90s hip-hop. He leaned into those sounds on 2019’s uknowhatimsayin¿, which was executive-produced by Q-Tip, and goes further on Quaranta, often dropping the nasal honk and frantic delivery in favor of a lower register and slower tempos. He’s never sounded more distant from the current wave of psychedelic rap he influenced, a fact that’s equally evident in his lyrics. The subject matter here is heavy and personal, even by Danny Brown standards—few rappers have aired out this sort of dirty laundry on record. “Down Wit It” delves into heartbreak and addiction (“Now it’s all over, can’t stay sober/Deep in my depression, hoping I can get over”) while “Quaranta'” undercuts Brown’s image with a grim dose of reality: “Lost everything in pursuit of my dream/Pushed everyone away, now no one here but me.”\",\n",
       " 'The moment JWords and maassai crossed paths, collaboration was inevitable. After meeting at a showcase in 2017, the New Jersey producer and Brooklyn rapper each felt they’d found a kindred spirit, deciding to unite the former’s knotty production with the latter’s blunt introspection as the duo H31R. On their 2020 debut ve · loc · i · ty, JWords laid Jersey club rhythms and boom-bap drums atop warped loops as maassai unspooled philosophical examinations of self. Their new record, HeadSpace, is a confident expansion of their electronic rap vision, with wonky, alien-sounding songs that feel beamed in from the future.\\nFor HeadSpace, JWords followed the synth-based blueprint of ve · loc · i · ty highlight “toxic behavior,” a flurry of lightning-speed kicks and locomotive hi-hats that charges through soft fog. The songs seem to glow from within: Textured, harmonically rich pulses drive “Backwards” and “Glass Ceiling,” while “Static” and “Train of Thought” feature glassy FM tones. JWords’s percussion sounds are warm and rubbery; bass drums land with a gooey throb and every snare has a satisfying mechanical snap.\\nIt’s the duo’s manipulation of rhythm that makes HeadSpace so entrancing. JWords seems to delight in pushing syncopation to new limits, often starting with a certain sequence only to completely scramble it. The agitated line that opens “Glitch in Time” threatens to wriggle free at any moment, but the song locks into place once JWords adds a rigid latticework of clicks and beeps. “Backwards” fits a loping, atonal synth figure into a stuttering drum pattern, constantly playing with the location of the downbeats. Occasionally, songs end before the groove can fully breathe—the ghostly drum’n’bass of “All Over the Place” could be a sprawling dancefloor jam, but disintegrates after one minute.\\nAs a rapper, maassai is equally beguiling. She subtly stretches and compresses her husky voice, delivering each line with a slight sneer. At first blush, her lyrics read as swaggering shit talk—“I ain’t eat dinner yet/But I’m so full of myself I could skip it,” she boasts on “Train of Thought”—but they’re often cues for deeper self-examination. She frequently alternates point of view, giving her raps a dreamlike, psychedelic quality. “When you scared of me, I’m scared too/You look at me and see you,” she raps on “Reflection,” her voice somewhere between a coo and a growl.\\nTogether, JWords and maassai create songs that feel like expertly assembled puzzles. On “Down Down Bb,” maassai spits rapid-fire lines as JWords’ kicks hang off the edge of each phrase: “Let me get the rhythm of your head/Let me get the rhythm of your feet.” On the closer “Air It Out,” JWords constructs a mechanical churn while maassai repeats certain phrases as if subject to delay, adding swing to the track’s grid. On HeadSpace, two potent solo artists tap into and augment each other’s strengths, practicing a kind of understated alchemy that doesn’t sound quite like anyone else.\\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

       " 'When Babyxsosa first emerged in 2018 with “Beat My Ass,” there was a chirpy, nursery-rhyme quality to the Virginia rapper-singer’s voice. She sings sweetly, her feathery vocals floating through the din like a snowflake in a gust of wind. As her profile grew, she began dabbling in ’80s-style synth-pop, plugg, and harsh industrial techno, the latter of which sounded like Yeezus compressed to 8-bit. Her voice is the one constant, cutting through the digital fog even as the music shuffles around. It feels like a sliding block puzzle operated by someone amped up on two cans of Logan Paul’s Prime energy drink.\\nEven for an artist prone to unexpected pivots, Babyxsosa’s new self-titled project feels like a left turn. Outside of its explosive centerpiece “Baby G,” the production is somber and stripped-back, consisting almost entirely of moody synthlines fit for a minimalist sci-fi film. That aesthetic choice puts more emphasis on Sosa’s vocals than ever, and she uses the extra space to lather her melodies in a cold, Auto-Tuned foam. It’s hard to make out the freestyled lyrics on “Introduction,” but her coos morph into ghostly wails over a yearning organ sample, her wistfulness overflowing with every breath. Babyxsosa is a radical departure from the boisterous sound she’s been tinkering with; “Beat My Ass,” this is not. She relies on these sparse vibes for the rest of the release with mixed results.\\nSimple vocal refrains melt into the backgrounds of songs, every element weightless and floating towards the ceiling. “Never Know/Viral” lingers on unfiltered confessions that eventually give way to Kid Cudi-style crooning. At just a little under a minute and a half, the track evaporates and leaves little time for respite before the bludgeoning, Playboi Carti-indebted “Baby G” gallops in. Then the drums and horns fade into the ether, and she’s back to singing sweet nothings on “That’s Just What They Say When They Don’t Know You Like I Know You.” The tonal whiplash is bizarre but intriguing, the bones of a romantic theme peeking through these pared-down flights of fancy. Still, the mechanics aren’t foolproof. Outside of that dizzying three-song structure, these tracks feel so raw they sometimes resemble demos more than finished statements.',\n",
       " 'In the spring of 2020, locked down in his New York apartment, Ali Sethi decided to turn his Instagram into a digital rehearsal space. At the same time every day, the Pakistani American singer and composer would sit down with his harmonium and tanpura, hit Instagram’s “Live” button, and spend an hour in freewheeling musical practice. He’d riff on Hindustani classical ragas, perform playful covers of South Asian classics, invite musician friends to log on and jam with him. It was during these sessions that he first began experimenting with spliced loops from Nicolás Jaar’s 2020 album Telas, improvising alaps over the Chilean American producer’s Stygian ambient soundscapes. When a mutual friend shared a recording of one of these experiments with Jaar, the producer reached out to Sethi via email. That kicked off a conversation that continues on their collaborative album Intiha, which features Sethi singing Urdu ghazals over re-worked loops from Telas, as well as new improvised sections courtesy of Jaar.\\nOn paper, the two seem unlikely collaborators. Sethi is best known for his experiments with the ghazal, a poetic-musical form that is the South Asian analog of the blues, with Sufi spiritual renegades singing songs steeped in metaphysical pathos. He may annoy Hindustani classical purists with his innovations—ragas re-imagined for piano accompaniment, Punjabi folk blended with synth-laden indie rock—but his music rarely strays far from mainstream-adjacent sounds. His 2022 breakthrough hit “Pasoori,” a collaboration with Pakistani singer Shae Gill, melds Punjabi folk, Turkish strings, and reggaeton beats into a thrilling romantic banger that would fit seamlessly on any Spotify pop playlist.\\nJaar’s music, on the other hand, seems to pull away from anything so obviously conventional or recognizable. Since breaking out with the minimalist techno of 2011’s Space Is Only Noise, he has pushed ever further into ambient abstraction. Even Against All Logic—his most accessible, dancefloor-friendly side project—bristles with harsh noise and gritty industrial textures. His solo work, particularly on Telas, resembles a primordial universe, swirling clouds of nebulous sound coming together and drifting apart in accordance with arcane physical laws.\\nYet somehow, maybe because both their practices are so deeply rooted in improvisation and recontextualisation, the meeting of these vastly divergent musical worlds isn’t as jarring as you might expect. When Sethi first sent Jaar voice notes with his vocal improvisations, Jaar realized that “it was what Telas had been missing.” Perhaps that’s why the record is called Intiha. The word translates as “limit” but can also refer to the point of “termination.” Having already released Telas in both “solid” (the four-track album) and “liquid” (an interactive website that allowed users to recombine the record’s sounds) configurations, Jaar may be signaling that this is the piece’s final, definitive form.',\n",
       " 'What are we doing here? Honestly, what are we doing with this “drumless” edition of Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories? What possible lessons can we learn from 2023’s second re-edition of Daft Punk’s third-best album, in which every sonic detail is the same, other than the absence of drums? Why on earth did Daft Punk, one of the savviest musical duos in modern memory, choose to release a largely superfluous album, when they could have simply ridden the residual good vibes of RAM’s 10th anniversary reissue from earlier this year? Why would anyone choose to listen to Daft Punk’s meticulously crafted fourth studio album with the work of two of the world’s best session drummers wiped from the surface?\\nIn the absence of an official explanation, speculation has thrived. Some fans claim that RAM Drumless is intended for DJs and producers who want to create their own RAM mixes and bootlegs, a logical enough idea that doesn’t account for the pricey Drumless merch or the major-label system and its outright revulsion for copyright-busting fan-made remixes. The big news is that Random Access Memories (Drumless Edition) really is just that: Random Access Memories with the drums removed. There’s no slinky disco hi-hat on “Get Lucky,” no explosive snare fills on “Contact,” no gentle cymbal taps on “Within,” not even a click track on “Giorgio by Moroder.” If this were another group you’d suspect a radical art prank, a sardonic comment, maybe, on the importance of drums to the house and techno music with which Daft Punk made their name. But Daft Punk don’t seem the type.\\nStripping the glossy RAM productions of their percussion does give other musical elements room to breathe—the bass, for example, feels a lot more prominent on “Giorgio by Moroder,” and you can really pick out how Todd Edwards’ brilliant microsample patchwork on “Fragments of Time” relates to the song’s bass and guitar lines. My own theory around Random Access Memories is that Daft Punk’s fourth album is, in effect, two records: a disco/soft rock/house album that houses the radio hits and a much more interesting, proggy, swirly record that lies alongside. By and large, the disco tunes—“Get Lucky,” “Lose Yourself to Dance,” “Instant Crush”—sound bereft of life in their Drumless versions, a low-carb diet beer watered down within an inch of its life. But the prog-leaning songs—“Within,” “Beyond,” “Motherboard,” etc.—fare a lot better.',\n",
       " 'On May 17, 1966, Bob Dylan gave a performance that would go down among the most significant of his career. In the four years since his debut album, he’d reached a level of reverence usually reserved for religious icons, with listeners approaching his folk songs as if they were commandments for navigating the turmoil of their era. But he was enamored with the possibilities of rock’n’roll, whose live-wire rhythms pulled his songs away from oratorical gravitas and toward a stranger sensibility—one full of surreal asides, inside jokes, and social critiques from an artist who had begun to see himself and his cohort as participants in the world’s hypocrisy, rather than innocent observers. On this night in May, the tension between Dylan’s inspiration and his audience’s expectations was particularly raw, with band and crowd egging each other toward a frenzy that culminated with the most famous heckle in rock history: “Judas!” Fans came to know the show by the name on a bootleg recording, which circulated widely and soon became another pillar of the Dylan legend: Royal Albert Hall.\\nExcept it didn’t happen at London’s Royal Albert Hall; it happened at Manchester Free Trade Hall, all the way on the other side of England, 200 miles northwest. The historical mix-up prompted by the mislabeled bootleg was only sorted out for good in 1995—the same year, incidentally, that Chan Marshall released her first album as Cat Power. Her latest, Cat Power Sings Dylan: The 1966 Royal Albert Hall Concert, is a song-by-song recreation of his set list that night. Marshall has a good bit in common with Dylan: an elliptical approach to subject matter, a sometimes fraught relationship with her audience, a willingness to follow her muse far afield from the sounds that made her famous, and tone and phrasing that can channel something deep about her sources when they’re divergent on the surface. Her decision to record her rendition not at the actual location of Dylan’s famous concert but at Royal Albert Hall itself reveals another kindred aspect between his trickster spirit and her own: the understanding that myth can be just as powerful—in its way, just as truthful—as fact.\\nAt first approach, Cat Power Sings Dylan is as straightforward as covers albums come. Marshall performed the music live, following every contour of Dylan’s set, down to his switch halfway through from solo acoustic performance to rollicking full-band rock. She didn’t tinker much with his arrangements: If a given song, in Dylan’s rendition, begins with an instrumental vamp or ends with a harmonica solo, it probably does in Marshall’s version as well. But after a while, the meticulous literalism of her interpretation comes to seem like its own conceptual gambit. When the similarities are so pronounced, the differences, when they inevitably occur, capture your attention. In the decades since 1966, Dylan’s performance has been enshrined as a pivotal moment not just in his own career but in pop music’s history, proving that rock stars were artists who could challenge their audiences, not just satisfy or entertain them—a single unruly evening standing in for a generational shift. Marshall’s treatment of the concept, from the title and location on down, comes across as both an earnest tribute to the “Royal Albert Hall” show and a probing investigation of its legend.',\n",
       " 'William Eggleston’s music, like his photography, lives in vivid color. The 84-year-old artist helped establish color photography as a medium worthy of institutional attention, elevating what was once considered purely commercial to the level of serious art. His photos are shot quickly, yet retain an honest, lived-in quality—in part thanks to his longstanding preoccupation with domestic interiors, aloof inlaws, personal trinkets, and other eccentricities of the American South. Roving and somewhat stiff, his 2017 album Musik unearthed a side of the photographer’s life once relegated to footnote status, compiling decades-old recordings captured on a Korg OW/1 FD Pro synthesizer. 512, Eggleston’s newly recorded follow-up, features warmer and more spacious improvisational piano compositions with an intimate, wide-eyed charm.\\nThe album takes its name from the unit number for Eggleston’s Memphis apartment, where it was recorded, and the music itself has a loose, domestic feel. A gentle brush of incidental noise in the opening moments of “Improvisation” places Eggleston at the piano bench, muttering under his breath before he’s joined by Brian Eno on bells. Eno’s touches are light and restrained, distinctly secondary to the tense stabs from Eggleston. The recordings have some continuity with the modernist lineage of jazz, or perhaps minimalism by way of Eno, but are more strongly influenced by the traditional folk and gospel music played on upright pianos across the U.S. for so much of the nation’s early history. The result is delightfully anachronistic and full of life.\\nThe record’s liveliness is partly thanks to choices made by producer Tom Lunt, who joined Eggleston in Memphis for the recording sessions. As both co-founder of the Numero Group and the archivist responsible for breathing new life into Eggleston’s earlier material, Lunt has a deep understanding of tradition. He invited session musicians like Sam Amidon, Matana Roberts, and Leo Abrahams to perform on the record, each adding subtle flourishes. “Ol’ Man River” is stoic and melancholy, with rolling fiddle and banjo lines from Amidon. “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes” achieves a similar depth of feeling by way of Roberts’ rich saxophone, which peek through in the piece’s softest moments.\\nWhile “Improvisation” and “That’s Some Robert Burns” are both original compositions, the album’s other four tracks are all American songbook standards. “Ol’ Man River,” “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” and “Over the Rainbow” all began life as sentimental show tunes, while “Onward Christian Soldiers” is an Anglican hymn that dates back to the mid-19th century. This distinction is, however, ultimately of little consequence for Eggleston, who strays away from anything resembling convention with his improvisations. “Onward Christian Soldiers” moves from pulsing minimalism to discordant jazz and back again, while “Over the Rainbow” leans into the delicate “soft pedal” technique so closely associated with Harold Budd. But where Budd uses the technique to achieve an icy distance on Eno-assisted albums like The Pearl, Eggleston’s playing is strikingly present, with a pastoral glow.\\nSo much about the world has changed since Eggleston first took up the piano, his “first calling” before the camera, in the early 1940s. Where his earlier archival recordings can feel rote and mechanical, like a bit of idle rehearsal time, 512 shows Eggleston reinterpreting his own past and the Southern musical traditions he grew up with. Much like his photographs, which once felt outrageously ordinary, his music provides a snapshot of the changing conditions of his life. 512 looks back with a full-hearted delight.\\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

       " 'The wellspring of Patrick Shiroishi’s torrential output—last year his name appeared on 32 albums, and there is every indication that he will break that record this year—is a conversation he had with his grandmother. When Shiroishi was young, he asked her about the Japanese internment camp at Tule Lake, California, where the U.S. government incarcerated nearly 30,000 people during World War II and where she met his grandfather. Normally chatty and amiable, she suddenly went stonily silent. Shiroishi has since used his saxophone to excavate his family’s history and grapple with Japanese Americans’ collective trauma. His first solo album was dedicated to his grandmother, others to his parents and his aunt. Shiroishi’s breakout solo effort, 2021’s Hidemi, narrated his grandfather’s life after Tule Lake through beautifully dense, multilayered compositions. Even Shiroishi’s collaborations with others—in his own bands Fuubutsushi, SSWAN, and Oort Smog and in countless duos, trios, and quartets—are modeled after his grandfather’s life: specifically, the sense of community that Patrick Hidemi Shiroishi helped build, as a deacon and small businessman, in Los Angeles’s Little Tokyo neighborhood.\\nI was too young to hear silence is the sparsest of Shiroishi’s releases, but its fragile improvisations also carry the weight of his family’s story. Recorded at 1:30 a.m. in a parking garage under a Japanese restaurant near his hometown of Rosemead, California, Shiroishi’s lone saxophone emanates from underground like the buried past crying out for remembrance. In the massive, empty building, trembling melodic lines are buttressed by long stretches of ambience, and sharp bursts of noise are met by reverberant echoes. Shiroishi cites the work of saxophonist Masayoshi Urabe, whose albums A Brute and Sōingyokusaiseyo are more silence than sound, as an influence on his minimalist approach. But just as important are location-dependent works like Pauline Oliveros’ recordings with the Deep Listening Band in an underground cistern or Akio Suzuki’s “o to da te” project, which maps points of strong echoes across urban areas. This isn’t the first time that Shiroishi has played in this garage—last year’s empty vessels, with Marta Tiesenga, was recorded there during the lockdown—but here he responds to the space as if it were the other half of a duo, an integral part of the unfurling composition.',\n",
       " 'The note of surprise on Hadsel, Beirut’s sixth studio LP, is not so much that Zach Condon has recorded an album on a remote Norwegian island with free access to a church organ, it’s that he hasn’t done so before. This sneaking feeling of familiarity is at the heart of Hadsel’s comfortable and occasionally underwhelming charm. Condon has, objectively, changed the Beirut sound since the Balkan brass days of Gulag Orkestar, his whirlwind 2006 debut. But his rich baritone croon, which swoops and curls around melodies like an eagle after a rabbit, is so distinctive, his brass arrangements so stridently mournful, that he can’t help but sound like himself.\\nHadsel, named after the municipality in which it was recorded, has its moments of reinvention. The use of the Hadsel kirke organ, whose ministerial drones underlie several of the album’s songs, introduces an austere, baroque elegance to the title track (especially) that is far removed from the ultra-bright tones of much modern pop music. For a blackened moment, the listener is transported to the hostile beauty and long nights of a Norwegian winter, the cold wind blowing around an icy wooden church. But as soon as the brass starts its stately call, we’re plunged right back into the world of Gulag Orkestar et al.\\nAt the same time, the modular synthesizers and drum machines that made their bow on 2019’s Gallipoli are more prominent on Hadsel. “January 18th,” “Spillhaugen,” and the second half of “Süddeutsches Ton-Bild-Studio” take on a borderline jolly, Switched-On Bach-style electronic wobble, while “Stokmarknes” and “The Tern” are marked by writhing electronic beats. But it almost feels like Condon has used these elements too well, weaving unfamiliar sounds around his lugubrious vocal so snugly that his invention slips by unheralded.\\nThis isn’t necessarily a problem, given the album’s lucidity and songwriting strength. Condon recorded Hadsel at a time of great personal difficulty, after health problems forced him to cut short Beirut’s Gallipoli tour in 2019. Upon arriving in Norway, he threw himself into recording as if “lost in a trance”; when he later returned to Berlin, rather than turn to his band for help, Condon fleshed out the Hadsel recordings on brass, percussion, and ukulele. The resulting sound is not exactly minimal, but it has greater clarity of purpose than Beirut’s more overblown records. This is an intimate, unflinching album that draws its power from Condon’s voice, which is frequently multi-tracked into giant choirs, like a lonely man who has invited his imaginary friends to a party.\\nIt remains thoroughly cathartic to hear Condon in full canorous flight, pushing simple vocal lines to grandiose conclusions. Drum machine aside, “So Many Plans” is a classic, horn-heavy Beirut heartbreaker in the style of “Elephant Gun.” “The Tern,” meanwhile, is a master class in pared-down songwriting, riding one melodic thought to towering emotional extremes. Condon went to Norway and came back with a familiar tangle of contradictions: Hadsel is a new beginning for Beirut that sounds like old times, a record born of despair and solitude that still feels full of life.\\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

       " 'Before Takahide Higuchi tried his hand at music, he dreamed of working as a game designer and bringing to life the fantasy worlds in his imagination. Though his initial experiments with RPG Maker software proved frustrating enough to put those ambitions aside, the Japanese producer’s abstract beatcraft under the name Foodman can often resemble the intricate worldbuilding of classic titles like Chrono Trigger and EarthBound. Inspired by the cut-and-pasted bricolage of footwork and juke, his songs are built out of tiny, chirping samples that skitter like 16-bit sprites ambling across the screen. Earlier works like 2021’s Yasuragi Land remained tethered to the conventions of club music, occasionally locking into bouncy four-on-the-floor grooves, but his new Uchigawa Tankentai EP is a detour into greater fragmentation.\\nTrue to its title, which translates to “inner journey,” the record is guided by a loose, instinctual sensibility, evolving organically rather than following a linear progression. “Hajimari,” for example, develops like a screen-recorded playthrough of Pikmin. While you can distinguish the vague outline of a rhythm beneath the track’s chaotically deployed samples, it’s more interesting to observe it from a distant point of view, as a self-contained ecosystem. Insectoid synths warble and coo as if in conversation while tom drums, reversed hi-hats, and visceral squelching noises illustrate the collective efforts of a hive foraging for food and constructing shelter. In the album’s introspective focus, it’s as if Higuchi’s soul-searching had distilled emotion down to a cartoon symbiosis between neurons and gut flora.\\nElsewhere, Higuchi inserts his own voice into the soundscape, turning splintered pieces into warped folk songs. On social media and in interviews, Higuchi often cites private moments like cold baths or lunches eaten alone as sources of inspiration, and on opener “Pichi Pichi,” he imitates the strained croak of an old man, waxing nostalgic about the texture of perfectly crisp potatoes and warm summer days as metallic synths clatter in the distance. The blend of sounds can be disjointed and sour, but that imperfection is by design. These sound like the tuneless songs you might sing to yourself while doing chores: snippets of naive expression that lend human intimacy to Foodman’s digital songcraft.\\nCovering five tracks in just 10 minutes, Uchigawa Tankentai is one of Foodman’s shortest releases. There’s charm in its diminutive scale, though a track like the 90-second “Hoso Michi” would benefit from further development. The interplay between its dissonant chords and MIDI choral arrangement is fascinating—like Anthony Braxton composing on a Dreamcast’s sound chip—but the song explodes into a whirlwind of drums and screams before the atmosphere can take hold. Despite its brevity, the EP succeeds as an opportunity for Foodman to steer his already eccentric artistry in a number of new directions without disrupting the flow of more conceptual LPs. Embracing the post-structural freedom evident in his earlier releases, it’s some of his most expressive—and challenging—work yet.',\n",
       " 'Spiritual Cramp have their very own Bez. Jose-Luna Gonzalez is the Bay Area band’s tambourine-playing mascot, popping up at their shows to provide auxiliary percussion and an extra sense of chaos to a group, usually outfitted in Fred Perry, who look like they could beat the shit out of you. Spiritual Cramp haven’t entirely carried this anarchic energy to their self-titled debut. Clear-cut and wound tight, there’s nothing here that could be considered auxiliary or chaotic. Across 10 tracks, the band packs in precise, hook-centered anthems with inspiring choruses: music made for people with a tried-and-tested vinegar solution for wiping the blood off their Brentham bombers.\\nTaking their name from a Christian Death song, Spiritual Cramp are among a wave of bands, including MSPAINT, Militarie Gun and Turnstile, who emerged from hardcore backgrounds and broadened their palettes to include softer, artsier flourishes. While those bands take their primary influences from the East Coast, Spiritual Cramp are proud anglophiles. Spiritual Cramp plays like a callback to 1977, when the Clash realized the natural alliances between punk and reggae, filtered through a hard-sashwaying garage rock lens. Spiritual Cramp integrate dub, spiky guitars, and oi-like crowd-starters, all with a kitschy wink rather than flatly imitating their predecessors. The music is ecstatic rather than enraged, semi-ridiculous rather than self-serious.\\nAs a frontman, Michael Bingham sounds like the kind of guy who insists on snuffing out a candle with his fingers. You can practically hear the pressure of his clenched-fists in the steady burble of his rabble-rousing voice. Across Spiritual Cramp, he switches between hubristic pomposity and a less mannered call for help. The album’s sequencing is buttressed on this swing: the pendulum ride between the imperious coke come-up and the humbling consequences of the come-down. “I wanna fly everywhere and put the miles on my credit card,” Bingham sings on “Slick Rick” like Iggy Pop at his puffed-up peak, before beginning the next song, “Talkin’ on the Internet,” with his tail between his legs: “Another day/Another credit card declined,” he whines.\\nBingham connects the political with the personal in the most on-the-nose way possible. “There’s a war on the TV and a war in my head,” he sings on “City on Fire” over a prickly guitar line. Bingham makes no attempt to be coy or subversive. His antiauthoritarianism scans gleefully teenage, his gestures deliberately vague. This isn’t to the band’s discredit: They’re striving for London Calling universality while knowing that cultural commentary isn’t their strong suit. Luckily, the songs are catchy enough to get away with it.\\nWhat Spiritual Cramp might lack in blood, it makes up for with zippy efficiency. The band pulls the focus away from its propensity for carnage and toward their instinctive sense of melody, trading disorder for a methodicalness that galvanizes rather than placates. It’s a smart move, and one that plays surprisingly well to their anthemic tendencies. Slick and indelible, Spiritual Cramp inspires the same kind of fist-pumping and pogo-ing as the band’s unhinged live shows.\\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
